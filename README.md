# Wander App

## About 

Wander is a travel journal app that helps you keep track of your travel memories by recording countries you've visited and logging journal entries for your journeys. You can choose to keep your journal entries private or share them with the Wander community. Easily view all of your travels in one place and collect badges for your travel milestones along the way.

## Getting Started

Once you've launched the app, you can explore countries and public journal entries without creating an account. 

If you want to take advantage of all functionality, you'll need to create an account by signing in with your Google account. 

To add a country, navigate to the "Countries" page and click "Add" for any countries you have visited.

Once you've added a country, you can create a Journal for your travels by clicking the "New Journal" button on your Profile page.

To logout, simply click the "Logout" button in the dropdown menu that appears in the top right corner of the app.

## Next Steps

Add ability to post questions in country pages. 

Add comment functionality for public journal entries.

Expand Mapbox GL JS API functionality.

Further improve the UI.
